===Intro:Boy is a ManPage lookup service
Boy is a replacement for UNIX's man command. Man, for non-unixers or graphical-only users, is manual documentation lookup. It can look up arbitrary information from files with the format of ===Type:OptText and the text below it, with the last line ending in a dash.

===Standards
Usually, a boy file will consist of the following headers: Intro:NameOfProgram, Command Line Options, Files, License, Extra (optional), Authors

For non-program documentation, do whatever you need to for the documentation at hand.

===Plans:Unfunished
There is one programmer working on this in his spare time. Over the weekend a bulk of this should get written, enough to be put into moderate use. I am planning to run the features on a test file, build the command-line-options, and then two weekends from now allow it to handle directories (thinking /usr/share/boy) for the manual documenation.

===Library
The library currently allows reading of titles and descriptions. Everything after the : in headers was going to be a different "Kind", but now I am just making it a "Comment" for the readers of the boyfiles. Boys are supposed to be readable and reading them is to be encouraged, so leaving little tips in the file will help with that sentiment.
